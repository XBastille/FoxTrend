                  The RHF Indicator Charts are provided by Robinhood Financial LLC (“RHF”) for informational purposes only and are not and should not be construed as an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any security. In addition, RHF Indicator Charts are not intended to serve as a recommendation to buy or sell any security in a self-directed RHF account or any other account. RHF Indicator Charts are not individualized, do not constitute research reports, and are not intended to serve as the basis for any investment decision.

                  The RHF Indicator Charts do not reflect the views of RHF or any of its affiliates and do not constitute or purport to provide legal, tax, or accounting or investment advice. Before making decisions with legal, tax, or accounting ramifications, you should consult appropriate professionals and/or investment adviser for advice that is specific to your situation. The advanced chart allows you to select different time spans ranging from 1 day to 5 years, each time span plots a time interval. The 1 day span, 5 minute interval has additional logic to only show the interval, when trades occur. This allows you to see when trading volume occurs during periods of slower activity like extended hours or thinly traded equities

                  The RHF Indicator Charts do not contain or purport to constitute forward-looking statements and do not reflect any expectation, belief, plan or prediction with respect to any security or index. The RHF Indicator Charts solely reflect past results of certain securities and indices. All investments involve risk and the past performance of a security, index or financial product does not guarantee future results or returns. Keep in mind that while diversification may help spread risk, it does not assure a profit or protect against loss. There is always the potential of losing money when you invest in securities or other financial products. Customers should consider their investment objectives and risks carefully before investing. The price of a given security may increase or decrease based on market conditions and customers may lose money, including their original investment. In addition, the information contained in the RHF Indicator Charts do not purport to present a complete picture of the financial position, activities, results, actions or future performance of any index or security. Neither RHF nor any of its data or content providers shall be liable for any errors or delays in the content, or for any actions taken in reliance thereon. In addition, as markets change continuously, previously published information and data may not be current and should not be relied upon.

                  Charts, including charts relating to your historic portfolio valuations or performance, or relating to past prices of specific securities, are provided for informational purposes only and should not be relied upon as an accurate or complete presentation of your portfolio value, gains or losses, or the value or financial position of any security.

Robinhood does not make any representation or guarantee relating to the accuracy, timeliness, or completeness of charts or any information or data on which they are based. Without limitation, charts may not accurately take into account the impact of events relating to a specific security, for example corporate actions such as stock splits, dividends, mergers and acquisitions, or events relating to your account or portfolio such as charges, deposits, or withdrawals, and may in certain circumstances overstate or understate gains or losses.

           <p>Moving average (MA) shows the average closing price over a period of time. It’s often used to track price trends. The period is defined by a number of intervals. The length of an interval depends on the span of the chart.

            Analysts compare MAs for different time periods to see whether or not they might expect further increases or decreases in the price of a security.</p>
