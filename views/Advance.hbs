                <p>While our Machine Learning model has been extensively trained on historical market data and patterns,

                    insights based on past trends, but market conditions can change rapidly due to various external

                        to
                        buy any security. In addition, RHF Indicator Charts are not intended to serve as a
                        recommendation to
                        buy or sell any security in a self-directed RHF account or any other account. RHF Indicator
                        Charts
                        are not individualized, do not constitute research reports, and are not intended to serve as the
                        basis for any investment decision.

                        The RHF Indicator Charts do not reflect the views of RHF or any of its affiliates and do not
                        constitute or purport to provide legal, tax, or accounting or investment advice. Before making
                        decisions with legal, tax, or accounting ramifications, you should consult appropriate
                        professionals
                        and/or investment adviser for advice that is specific to your situation. The advanced chart
                        allows
                        you to select different time spans ranging from 1 day to 5 years, each time span plots a time
                        interval. The 1 day span, 5 minute interval has additional logic to only show the interval, when
                        trades occur. This allows you to see when trading volume occurs during periods of slower
                        activity
                        like extended hours or thinly traded equities

                        The RHF Indicator Charts do not contain or purport to constitute forward-looking statements and
                        do

                        The
                        RHF Indicator Charts solely reflect past results of certain securities and indices. All
                        investments
                        involve risk and the past performance of a security, index or financial product does not
                        guarantee
                        future results or returns. Keep in mind that while diversification may help spread risk, it does
                        not
                        assure a profit or protect against loss. There is always the potential of losing money when you
                        invest in securities or other financial products. Customers should consider their investment
                        objectives and risks carefully before investing. The price of a given security may increase or
                        decrease based on market conditions and customers may lose money, including their original
                        investment. In addition, the information contained in the RHF Indicator Charts do not purport to
                        present a complete picture of the financial position, activities, results, actions or future

                        <p>Moving average (MA) shows the average closing price over a period of time. It’s often used to
                            track price trends. The period is defined by a number of intervals. The length of an
                            interval
                            depends on the span of the chart.

                            Analysts compare MAs for different time periods to see whether or not they might expect
                            further
                            increases or decreases in the price of a security.</p>
